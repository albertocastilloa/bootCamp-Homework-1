# bootCamp-Homework-1
Repository of the very first homework from Data Analytics Boot Camp of Tec de Monterrey

Background:

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

Create a report in Microsoft Word and answer the following questions.

Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
What are some limitations of this dataset?
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
